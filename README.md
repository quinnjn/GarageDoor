GarageDoor
==========

Raspberry Pi setup for my Garage door. 

### Purpose

I'm currently renting a basement suite which luckily comes with my own garage. The problem though is it only has one garage door opener which sucks when: I want to go biking, motorcycling, enter the garage myself.

If only there was a way to open my garage door through my cell phone! Now there is!

### Parts Required
